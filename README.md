 ### Recommender Systems based on Machine Learning and Neural Networks Working:Ghanta

 IDEA
 Category:Health and Fitness
(RN):Recent studies have shown that there is growing disinterest amongst school children with regards to physical fitness.School-goers are more intersted in social media.
We plan to create an app that integrates social media and health apps. HealthyUs is a React Native App that will allow users to post updates about their Diet and Exercise plans. Friends can hence follow each others' health achievements and stay motivated to do better everyday.

(AI):When someone posts in the Diet category, you can also view the amount of calories that the food had.
Similarly, someone's posture can be evaluted as good or bad, when they post in Exercise category.

(AI):The real gem of our application is Trainer H, an AI that will recommend diets and exercises as well as predict calorie burning goals.
